## 📖 About The Project

**UrbanRoots** is a modern web platform designed to demystify horticulture for city living. Moving away from the rustic aesthetic, UrbanRoots utilizes a **"Hydro-Luxe"** design language—combining deep charcoal interfaces with neon green accents—to reflect the future of agri-tech, hydroponics, and vertical farming.

This project is a complete conceptual pivot from the "TechWave" podcast template, repurposed into a resource hub for:
* Vertical Gardening techniques.
* Zero-waste & Composting strategies.
* Community Seed Swapping.
* Data-driven plant care.

## ✨ Key Features

* **🧪 Masterclasses:** High-definition video tutorials with close-up angles of planting techniques.
* **📱 Garden-Side Mode:** A mobile-first interface designed for outdoor readability while you work in the dirt.
* **🌍 Seed Swap Network:** Connects users with local growers in over 120 cities to trade cuttings and seeds.
* **📊 Growth Trackers:** Digital care schedules, watering algorithms, and printable checklists.
* **🛡️ Bio-Protection:** Guides on pest control using organic oils and natural predators (no harsh chemicals).

## 🎨 Design System: "Hydro-Luxe"

The interface uses a high-contrast dark mode with a signature 3-color gradient representing the transition from **Sprout (Green)** to **Water (Blue)** to **Depth (Deep Blue)**.

### Color Palette

| Color Name | Hex Code | Usage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Neon Sprout** | ` #00f5a0 ` | Primary Action / Highlights / The "New" Badge |
| **Carbon Soil** | ` #0F1115 ` | Global Background (Deep Charcoal) |
| **Night Moss** | ` #162621 ` | Card Backgrounds / UI Surfaces |
| **Clean Air** | ` #F5F7FA ` | Primary Text |

### The "Hydro" Gradient
Used for primary buttons, borders, and the Hero Circle.

```css
--gradient-hydro: linear-gradient(135deg, #00f5a0 0%, #00D2FF 50%, #3A7BD5 100%);
